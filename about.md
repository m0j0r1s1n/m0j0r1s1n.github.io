# About Me.

This page tells you a little bit about me.
And there is not much to tell, apart from:

My name is m0j0 (for now) and I love Cyber things. 
I am also a loving Husband/Father/Carer and Tech nerd.

I am currently studying the R60 BSc at the Open University going into my 3rd year.
I have had a couple of goes at this but the past 2 years... I'll not bore
you.

So far I have completed 8 modules which has gained me a Diploma in HE (Higher Education). 
This year I am finishing TM352 which is the Level 3 Web/Mobile/Cloud module offered by 
[The Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/).

It only began on October the 5th so early, so far I am enjoying it :) This will lead me up to 
System Pen-Testing one I look forward too, although have heard conflicting reports.

Completed Modules to date (Oct 24):

- Year 1 Modules:
  - TM111 
  - TM112
  - TM129
  - MU123

- Year 2 Modules:
  - TT284
  - TM257
  - TM255
  - TM256

- Year 3 Modules:
  - TM352
  - TM359

Anyway [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/home) is my practice grounds and the Academy for learnings. I am building 
these GitHub page/s to reinforce some machines I have completed so I have to try
them again and write better notes and save commands I have learnt.

See you soon (:
