# About Me.

This page tells you a little bit about me.
And there is not much to tell, apart from:

My name is m0j0 (for now) and I love Cyber things.
I am studying the R60 BSc at the Open University going into my 3rd year.
I have had a couple of goes at this but the past 2 years... I'll not bore
you.

Anyway HTB is my practice grounds and the Academy for learnings. I am building 
this GitHub page/s to reinforce some machines I have completed so I have to try
them again and write better notes and save commands I have learnt.

I am also learning Python in the evenings (self taught) so I'm sure a few 
hissy thing will pop onto it.

Another language I love is Bash which I have a few scripts from over the years
that I will upload for criticism once I finish the design if the pages.

See you soon (:
