# About Me.

This page tells you a little bit about me.
And there is not much to tell, apart from:

My name is m0j0 (for now) and I love Cyber things. 
I am also a loving Husband/Father/Carer and Tech nerd.

I am currently studying the R60 BSc at the Open University going into my 3rd year.
I have had a couple of goes at this but the past 2 years... I'll not bore
you.

So far I have completed 7 modules and this year I am finishing TM256 which is the
Cyber Security module offered by [The Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/).

Completed Modules:

- Year 1 Modules:
  - TM111 
  - TM112
  - TM129
  - MU123

- Year 2 Modules:
  - TT284
  - TM257
  - TM255

TM256 will complete the year 2 block (:

Anyway [HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/home) is my practice grounds and the Academy for learnings. I am building 
these GitHub page/s to reinforce some machines I have completed so I have to try
them again and write better notes and save commands I have learnt.

I am also learning Python in the evenings (self taught) so I'm sure a few 
hissy thing will pop onto it.

Another language I love is Bash which I have a few scripts from over the years
that I will upload for criticism once I finish the design if the pages.

See you soon (:
