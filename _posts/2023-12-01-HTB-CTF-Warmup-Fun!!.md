It's near upon me and the OUCSS team for the latest Uni CTF with Hack the Box.

I decided to go over some old write-ups from previous years and other events 
like [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/login) just to get that CTF mindset again.

It is a game of Love and Hate when playing CTF's for me but the key thing I 
have learnt over the years is not too get frustrated and just be happy that
you participated. We all are here to gain that little bit more knowledge and
these for sure give you some, albeit in a totally different format.

I have landed on [HTB's](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/wrong-spooky-season)
very easy Forensics challenge. Gotta start somewhere and very easy on HTB can be
well... let's just find out by trying it. 

I'll show some methodolgy once I have cracked it.
