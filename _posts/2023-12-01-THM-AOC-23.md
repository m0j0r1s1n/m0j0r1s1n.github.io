Advent of Cyber 2023 has arrived and I will play along each day like
previous years as it is always a fun journey on the lead up to Xmas.

With prizes if you are lucky - I'm generally not but I'll give it a shot
if you head to [TryHackMe's](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2023)
you can read the list of prizes as it's actually too big to list here.

Read along with the story and complete the early challenges which are really 
prompts about the story and ToS. Before I know it I will be helping save
Xmas each day on the run up to Xmas xD.

I completed Day 1 an interesting lesson on AI and "prompt injection attacks".
It was cool interacting with the ChatBot and getting that sensitve info.
And will make me prod my on AI now xD.

Day 2 complete. It is a log analysis tutorial that I did not really like as
it was a spli screen mode and Jupyter notebooks involved.  As I am doing this
on my Hacktop my screen is only 16" and my eyes ain't as good as they where
when I was 21 - please THM think of us oldies.  

Anyway one thing is it has made me want to go a play with Python for some Data
Analysis and I have some tutorials on it.  Maybe I can do a post on it.
