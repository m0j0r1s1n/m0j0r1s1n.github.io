Well that was actually quite fun.  "What you say". The latest box from HTB.

[HTB-Hospital Achievement](https://www.hackthebox.com/achievement/machine/142920/576)

As I have said before I can't speak of the approach I took but I can say one 
thing.
If I want to improve I need to try more Windows machines, as I do really struggle.
I made a rookie error in my opinion on this box so I am detemined to go and play
some guided Windows machines and possibly put my methodology here (: for some
constructive crticism XD.

### What Next!!

I'm going to go and play a guided machine on my new laptop, yeah I got power now
and **try** and make a semi readable walkthrough of how I struggle at windows.
