Advent of Cyber 2023 has arrived and I will play along each day like
previous years as it is always a fun journey on the lead up to Xmas.

With prizes if you are lucky - I'm generally not but I'll give it a shot
if you head to [TryHackMe's](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2023)
you can read the list of prizes as it's actually too big to list here.

Read along with the story and complete the early challenges which are really 
prompts about the story and ToS. Before I know it I will be helping save
Xmas each day on the run up to Xmas xD.
